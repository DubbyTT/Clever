(subset of Chatty's 3000+ lines of code... clever "turntable.fm" bot)

A NodeJS Turntable.fm bot that interfaces with the surprisingly real
Cleverbot.com API, allowing an unlimited number of users to hold
unique conversations with your bot via PM.  The conversation history
is stored in an array so the conversation can be picked up right 
where you left off.  Time stamps are added as well, in case you would
like to add a way to delete old conversations to reduce memory usage.
In practice this has run for a month without any pruning and never 
consumed more than 10MB or so for the node process.

This API was converted from Ruby to Javascript for NodeJS.
