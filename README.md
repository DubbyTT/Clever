// (subset of Chatty's 3000+ lines of code... clever "turntable.fm" bot)
//
// A NodeJS Turntable.fm bot that interfaces with the surprisingly real
// Cleverbot.com API, allowing an unlimited number of users to hold
// unique conversations with your bot via PM.  The conversation history
// is stored in an array so the conversation can be picked up right 
// where you left off.  Time stamps are added as well, in case you would
// like to add a way to delete old conversations to reduce memory usage.
// In practice this has run for a month without any pruning and never 
// consumed more than 10MB or so for the node process.
//
// This API was converted from Ruby to Javascript for NodeJS.
// Origin: v0.0.3 of https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/cleverbot-api
